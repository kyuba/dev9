  <abstract>
   <para>dev9 is a /dev manager for Linux systems. The idea is to implement a
    9p2000.u filesystem in userspace to do the tasks of the old
    <quote>devfs</quote> filesystem.</para>

  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>Currently, most Linux systems have a number of options for managing
   the special /dev directory. Typical desktop distributions, for example, tend
   to use the <quote>udev</quote> daemon, whereas embedded devices often have a
   static /dev, or use <quote>mdev</quote>. Some desktop distributions may also
   use udev after the system has booted up, but rely on mdev while the system is
   in an autoconfiguring initramfs. Older or modern but more exotic Linux
   distributions on the other hand may use the special <quote>devfs</quote>
   pseudo-filesystem.</para>

  <para>There's a number of issues with these management methods: udev is
   theoretically nice, but it's easily integrated poorly into the system startup
   sequence, thus resulting in poor bootup speeds when used with excessive
   amounts of shell scripting for coldplugging of devices. Static /dev
   management is very swift, but it must be kept up-to-date manually or by
   periodically running maintenance tasks, and it also has the disadvantage of
   not allowing for nice features like a more meaningful device naming scheme.
   Devfs was up to a nice start, but it eventually suffered from bitrot and has
   been removed from most kernel patchsets. Mdev is slick and fast, but it isn't
   supposed to be kept running to update /dev if new devices are added to the
   system while it is running, which is an issue that a static /dev suffers from
   as well.</para>

  <para>To aleviate these issues, we're trying to build a programme that is sort
   of a combination of devfs and udev; that is, a device-managing filesystem
   implemented in userspace, using the 9p2000.u protocol. This has a number of
   advantages, which will be pointed out in this paper.</para>

  <title>Concept</title>

  <para>This chapter will sum up the general idea of how dev9 is going to work,
   and how it's supposed to be used by init programmes and users.</para>

  <section id="pc-configuration">
   <title>Configuration</title>

   <para>All the configuration data will be stored as S-expressions in textual
    form, because S-expressions are easy, and fast to parse. Unlike XML or other
    textual storage methods, they're also typed and a parser is easily
    implemented in under 10k of object code.</para>

   <para>Configuration data should be stored in /etc/dev9 or the appropriate
    location for the file hierarchy system in use. Additionally, the daemon will
    need to accept its configuration files via the command-line, so that an init
    or a user is able to adjust the configuration as needed.</para>

  <title>OS requirements</title>

  <para>This project is, by its very definition, strictly Linux-only, so
   portability is not going to be any issue whatsoever, save for portability
   between different Linux kernel versions and architecture-specific
   issues.</para>

  <section id="sor-kernel-requirements">
   <title>Kernel requirements</title>

   <para>Like any 9p2000.u filesystem, this project will require a running
    kernel with support for the 9p2000.u (network) filesystem protocol. Since
    patches for this have been included in the vanilla 2.6.x kernel sources for
    a number of versions now, this shouldn't pose much of a problem.</para>

   <para>Additionally, this programme will require support for sysfs and netlink
    in the kernel. Both of these would also be required for udev to work.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="sor-library-requirements">
   <title>Library requirements</title>

   <para>To achieve minimal code size, dev9 will rely on the Atomic-LibC
    project. This should make for extremely small binaries, as well as provide
    the code needed to deal with S-expressions.</para>
